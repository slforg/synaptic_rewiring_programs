# synaptic_rewiring_programs
"Readme.pdf" describes how to use a set of programs to conduct the activity-dependent synaptic rewiring of afferent inputs from the model lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the model visual cortex, and analyze simulated results such as orientation selectivity and spatiotemporal receptive fields of individual model neurons and orientation maps in the model visual cortex. “Synaptic rewiring” here is a form of self-organization of synaptic connections, in which a synaptic input from an LGN neuron is replaced by a synaptic input from another LGN neuron at each simulation step depending on the coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic neuronal activities. Therefore, synaptic rewiring is relevant to structural plasticity during the postnatal development of neural circuits.
